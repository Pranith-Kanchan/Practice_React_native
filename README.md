🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Deep Link
Deep linking lets your app open specific screens directly from a URL.

Configure the URL scheme in your project settings.

Example: myapp://details/123 opens the details page for item 123.

Use Linking in React Native to handle and open links.

2️⃣ Animation — Card Flip
Card flip animation adds a smooth 3D flipping effect to your UI.

Tap the card to flip between front and back views.

Great for showing hidden information or interactive designs.

Can be done using React Native Animated API or libraries like react-native-reanimated.
